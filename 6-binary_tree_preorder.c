/**
 * binary_tree_preorder - Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse.

 *
 * Description: In pre-order traversal, we visit the root node first,
 * then recursively do a pre-order traversal of the left subtree,
 * followed by a pre-order traversal of the right subtree.
 *
 * Return: void
